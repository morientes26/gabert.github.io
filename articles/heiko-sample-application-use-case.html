<h3>Heiko Sample Application: Use Case</h3>

<p>
Clima Controll Sample Application demonstrates controlling climatization based on thermometer value. Our very simple clima can be set to one of three states: OFF, MEDIUM or HIGH. Since we want clima to be controlled entirely by <strong>SDx Controller</strong> we have deployed controlling logic into SDx Controller.

Clima will be controlled by following pseudo logic:
<pre><code>
if temperature < 20                      => clima = OFF
if temperature >= 20 && temperature < 30 => clima = MEDIUM
if temperature >= 30                     => clima = HIGH
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
Clima will be controlled in two different houses in different towns. Big House in Las Vegas and some imaginary Apartment in Toronto.
Heiko uses tree like organization of components. In our case tree looks like the following one:
<pre><code>
/--- DATA TREE
   /---las-vegas
   |   /---big-house
   |       ---clima
   |       ---thermometer
   |
   /---toronto
       /---apartement
           ---clima
           ---thermometer
</code></pre>
Clima and Thermometer are actually dummy devices. Under normal circumstances thermometer value would be either polled/read by some process, or in case of more advanced protocol, thermometer could provide us by events. For now lets just cheat a bit, and set value of thermometer manually. We expect from <strong>Heiko</strong> that as soon as value of thermometer change is detected, <strong>SDx Controller</strong> will set clima power to reflect this change.
